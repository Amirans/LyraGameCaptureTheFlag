# Welcome to Lyra Capture the Flag Game Mode!

![Lyra Start Game Capture the Flag](https://i.imgur.com/5UdE4Ah.png)

Unreal Engine 5 comes with a new feature called [Gameplay Feature Plugins](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/game-features-and-modular-gameplay/) allowing for modular and standalone game content. The [Lyra Starter game](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/lyra) already uses this feature extensively to create modular game modes such as the Control point and the Team deathmatch.

This plugin is a standalone Capture the Flag game mode that can be added to the Lyra Start Game without any changes to the core content of the project.

# Installation

- Install Unreal Engine 5.0 and above
- Download Lyra Starter Game Project
- Download and extract this plugin into the projects following directory  **LyraStarterGame\Plugins\GameFeatures\\**

## Roadmap

There are some missing features that are not implemented yet.
- AI Capture the flag logic
- Players carrying the flag should drop the flag in place after dying
