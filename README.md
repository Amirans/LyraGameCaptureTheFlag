# Welcome to Lyra Capture the Flag Game Mode!

Unreal Engine 5 comes with a new feature called [Game Features Plugins](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/game-features-and-modular-gameplay/) allowing for modular and standalone game content. The [Lyra Starter game](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/lyra) already uses this feature extensively to create modular game modes such as the Control point and the Team deathmatch.

This plugin is a standalone Capture the Flag game mode that can be added to the Lyra Start Game without any changes to the core content of the project.
